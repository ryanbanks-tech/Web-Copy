The goal of this post is to document <i>everything</i> that I found useful
both before and after my spine surgery. Be warned; this is a very long post
and I recommend that interested readers consume it in manageable pieces.
Different readers may be interested in different parts of the blog. For this
reason, I've built a navigable "table of contents" below.

Ten years ago, I shared an apartment with two other US Marine officers as
we attended a training course. I became close friends with one of them during
our 6 months together, but like many military relationships, we grew apart
when the course ended. Notwithstanding a brief reunion in Afghanistan, I
hadn't seen this friend since the apartment days. That recently changed.

At a large trade show this summer, I bumped into a man in an elevator who
recognized my name. He introduced himself as if we were old pals but I
honestly couldn't recall meeting him. About 5 minutes after the elevator ride,
it hit me. I remembered him from an online chatroom trying to learn about IT
operations automation. I figured he was a junior engineer just tinkering
around. Oh, how wrong I was.

I attended the Interop conference in 2019, which was both my first time
attending and speaking at the event. After my talk, I spoke to many audience
members, awkwardly carrying a laptop and power supply while trying to shake
hands.  I ended up losing my power supply and this frustrated me. I
spent probably 10 minutes looking for it, but I suspect it was casually
snagged by another attendee.

When I enlisted in the US Marine Corps in 2004, I did so as an assaultman.
This is an infantry role with a specialization in small-scale demolitions and
rocket launchers. To an 18-year-old, this sounded pretty cool. One thing I
totally underestimated about the military was their focus on "brilliance in
the basics" in everything they do.

Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt's 1984 book "The Goal" is one of my favorites of all time.
Entertaining, witty, and relatable, the book is a novel that follows a plant
manager as he turns his plant around under the guidance of Goldratt's literary
reincarnation. Superficially, it was a manufacturing book, but at a deeper
level, it revealed our collective inability to measure the right things.

unnecessary, last-minute meetings. I've been thinking about this regularly and
I want to suggest a solution which combines suggestions from several different
business authors. First, I need to provide some context about their background.

A few months ago, I submitted a proposal on a technical topic for which I am
certain there is a market. Initially, the prospect was excited about it. I
hurried to build a course scenario and develop my plan. The prospect then
forwarded my proposal to a technical reviewer, and that's when things got
interesting.

I am always astounded by how many purchasing departments measure
costs. They are quick to break out their spreadsheet programs to tabulate the
cost of parts, labor, freight, and capital. Inept Government officials do it, too.
While the cost of capital helps approximate the ever-decreasing value of money
over time, it doesn't account for other hidden costs: those of transaction and
opportunity.

saying monopolies are bad for consumers, which is obviously true and

Earlier this year, I consulted for an organization with about 8 independent
data communications networks. Some of these networks were highly
sensitive and warranted such separation, while others could, both technically
and politically, be merged onto shared infrastructure. Such a hardware
consolidation would reduce both capital and operating costs for the
customer. Now, suppose you were a network device supplier staring at a 70%
drop in revenue.

is far more expensive than doing it right the first time. Womack is not alone.
Phillip Crosby's 1979 book "Quality is Free" coined the term.

The name of this blog is sure to rile up the cynical folks in the crowd
and perhaps drive you one step closer to nihilism. I want to provide a few
simple examples of winning together in the business world, and specifically,
<b>beyond company boundaries.</b>

    <title>The Soul of a Slave</title>

"The soul of a free man looks at life as a series of problems to be solved and
solves them, while the soul of a slave whines, 'What can I do who am but a
slave?'" writes George S. Clason in his 1926 book "The Richest Man in Babylon".
No, this is not a blog post on the heinous act of slavery. It's not a money
talk, either. It's a blog post on overcoming problems using mankind's inherent
gift; critical thought.

This comparison has been beaten to death on the Internet by people much
smarter on these topics than I. I'll briefly review both and explain
how I've seen these methodologies work firsthand <b>outside</b> of
software development.

In late 2017, I was struggling to understand some of the core concepts
underlying DevOps technologies. I knew deep down that I simply
did not have time to sit and read traditional books. Some of you are saying
this is an excuse. With a full time job, a wife that works full time, and a
1-year-old daughter at the time, it just wasn't going to happen. Both my wife
and I are regular gym-goers and aren't willing to sacrifice that. Many of
you have followed me on the web for years and know how much I contribute
to the community, and I'm not willing to tune that down, either. I had to
find a way to keep expanding my knowledge without investing more time.

I'm not going to hold anything back. <b>Get rid of your television.</b>
Being entertained via TV programming is probably the most passive activity in
the world, except for sleeping. I'm not knocking it because it is
physically lazy (although it certainly is), but rather because it has the
capacity to completely transform someone's life in a negative way.

If you are a professional accountant, investor, or business owner, you can stop
right here. This blog is for the financially-challenged technocrats among us.
It wasn't until early 2017 that I realized how ignorant I was on these
topics, so I picked up a $10 Udemy course by Chris Haroun titled "An
Entire MBA in One Course". It's a great place to start and one of the best
$10 purchases I've ever made.

    <title>Good, Cheap, Fast; Pick Any Three</title>

The age-old adage says that you can only choose two attributes
from the list of "good, cheap, or fast". I've seen all kinds of fancy
mathematical graphs depicting a three-dimensional parabola that
shows the limits of how the inputs of quality, cost, and lead time
all interact. The CAP theorem for databases similarly suggests you can
choose consistency, availability, or partition tolerance, but never
all three. You can choose two, we are told, and trade-off
the third. Intuitively, this makes sense, but is it a general truth?
Let's examine all three possibilies.

    <title>Mind Your Own Business</title>

Robert Kiyosaki's 1997 book "Rich Dad Poor Dad" suggests that
we all "mind our own business". He's clear in stating that
your "business" isn't your place of employment, but rather
what <b>you</b> do to make money. Are you an author, podcaster,
weekend lawnmower, investor, or something else? Figure out
what topics interest you, and start thinking about how you
can deliver unique value in those spaces. Note that non-profit
or charity work qualifies as a "business" too, so long as you
aren't someone else's employee while you do it.

Perhaps a controversial topic, but an important one. All sectors of
all industries have their share of eternally "busy" people. They
peck away at their laptops during strategic meetings, dial into
back-to-back conference calls, and contort themselves into cogs that fit
perfectly into the machine that preserves the status quo.

"That makes no sense", I told a business manager. "Why would we pay $100 per
month for that service when we could buy a compute platform to run it for
$3000? It pays for itself in two and a half years." I was convinced
that these office-dwellers had no idea how to multiply.

At Cisco Live US 2018, attendees could volunteer to support an effort known
as "Clean the World". Volunteers would create support packages for the world
community where sanitation is poor or nonexistent. I always volunteer for
things like this because it is good for humanity and doesn't take much time.
